# .dotfiles

This is my dotfiles, I primarily use MacOS as my main os and have collecting my configurations files. In the future I might try getting into learning Linux. For now, I have tried severals distro such as, ubuntu, pop os, elementary os and linux mint. However, I am looking forward to lurk into the world of Arch linux and configure the system to my workflow.

The main things here are:

  1. My vim configuration.
  2. My zsh configuration.
  3. My vifm configuration.
