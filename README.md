# .dotfiles

Welcome to my personal collection of dotfiles. As a macOS user, I've curated various configuration files to streamline and enhance my development workflow. My explorations into Linux have been broad, dabbling with distributions such as Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS, Elementary OS, and Linux Mint, each contributing to my understanding and preferences in setting up my environment.

This repository houses my configurations for:

Vim: Tailored settings for my preferred editor, optimizing my coding experience.  
Zsh: Customizations for the Z shell that enhance my terminal usability.  
Tmux: Configuration for managing multiple terminal sessions effortlessly.  
Coc: Conquer of Completion settings for a rich coding experience in Vim.  
Setup Script: A convenient script to automate the setup of these tools on a new machine.

Feel free to use and adapt these configurations to fit your own development needs. Enjoy crafting your ideal environment!
